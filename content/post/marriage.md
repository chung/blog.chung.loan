“A great marriage is not when the ‘perfect couple’ comes together. It is when an imperfect couple learns to enjoy their differences.”
– Dave Meurer


Today we finally got marriaged. After sometimes discussing whether we should keep the relationship as lovers or should we commit to marriage. And the final decision is getting married.

We have works to do. We need to learn and enjoy the differences between us, which is quite a few. But I have faith in our relationship. We will survive.

Lets our journey begin.
