“A great marriage is not when the ‘perfect couple’ comes together. It is when an imperfect couple learns to enjoy their differences.”
– Dave Meurer

Today we finally got marriaged. After ups and downs. And yes, here we are husband and wife.

We cannot agree more about the quote. We simply are very different. We need to learn to enjoy the differences.
